4. I downloaded the GitHub desktop app, logged into my GitHub account, then there were 3 tabs to the right. I chose the "Clone a repository" tab and cloned veturon2.github.io and set the location on my desktop in a folder called CTI-110 and then put it in a folder within called Labs, that way I know where to locate it on my computer.
